<h1>AISTATS 2015 Instructions for Presenters</h1>

<h2>Poster Presentations</h2>

<p>The poster boards have 1.2<I>m</I> (4 ft) width and 2.4<I>m</I> (8 ft) height. 
Your poster may be either in landscape or in portrait orientation.

<p>All posters should be removed immediately following the sessions in which they were presented. 
Posters for the next session should go up no sooner than after the morning session.



<h2>Oral Presentations</h2>

<p>For each oral presentation, 30 minutes will be provided, including Q&A discussion and transition time. We recommend presenters to prepare 22-23 minutes talk, which will spare 5 minutes for discussion and 1-2 minutes of transition betwen speakers.
<b>Please contact the session chair 15 minutes before the start of the session.</b>

<p>The conference room does not furnish a computer. 
Presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptops, with the slides in it. 
If it is not possible, presenters may ask renting a laptop to the session chair or one of the organizing committee members.

<p>Please try your laptop and slides out during the break before your session. 
You can connect to the projector using a standard VGA connector and a standard audio jack. 
We will attempt to have some adapters on-hand, but speakers should ensure that they bring any 
necessary cables needed to connect to a VGA projector.

<p>Microphones are provided (wired and wireless). We also have two wireless mics that can be passed around for Q&amp;A.

Papers presented as talks are NOT presented as posters. Oral speakers do not need to prepare their posters.

<p>Video recordings will be made of oral presentations; more details to be announced.
