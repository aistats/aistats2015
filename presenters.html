<h1>AISTATS 2015 Instructions for Presenters</h1>

<h2>Poster Presentations</h2>

<p>The poster boards have 1.2<I>m</I> (4 ft) width and 2.4<I>m</I> (8 ft) height. 
Your poster may be either in landscape or in portrait orientation.

<p>All posters should be removed immediately following the sessions in which they were presented. 
Posters for the next session should go up no sooner than after the morning session.


<!--
<p>We have a very high turnout for AISTATS this year, and the poster 
sessions will be somewhat crowded, so it is important to have the 
posters set up before the session starts.

<ul>
<li>For the Tuesday session, 
presenters can set up their posters during the registration period (8:00-9:00).
Posters must be taken down by the end of the Tuesday 
paper sessions.
<li>For the Thursday session, AISTATS presenters can set up 
their posters either during the morning registration period 
or during the lunch break, and they must be removed at the 
end of the evening poster session. 
<li>For the Thursday session, MLSS student posters 
can be hung in Hvammur (see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/poster_sessions.html#session2">map of the Thursday poster session layout</a>) on a first-come 
first-served basis between 15:00 and 17:00, and should be 
left mounted for the Friday poster session as well; they 
need to be taken down after the Friday poster session.
If there is not enough room for all MLSS posters in Hvammur, 
students may spill into the overflow area just outside 
the main exhibit area.
</ul>

<h2>Oral Presentations</h2>

<p>For each oral presentation, 30 minutes will be provided, including Q&A discussion and transition time. We recommend presenters to prepare 22-23 minutes talk, which will spare 5 minutes for discussion and 1-2 minutes of transition betwen speakers.
<b>Please contact the session chair 15 minutes before the start of the session.</b>

<p>The conference room does not furnish a computer. 
Presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptops, with the slides in it. 
If it is not possible, presenters may ask renting a laptop to the session chair or one of the organizing committee members.

<p>Please try your laptop and slides out during the break before your session. 
You can connect to the projector using a standard VGA connector and a standard audio jack. 
We will attempt to have some adapters on-hand, but speakers should ensure that they bring any 
necessary cables needed to connect to a VGA projector.

<p>Microphones are provided (wired and wireless). We also have two wireless mics that can be passed around for Q&amp;A.

<p><font color="#888888"><strike>Please note that all papers presented as talks also have a corresponding poster presentation.</strike></font>
Papers presented as talks are NOT presented as posters. Oral speakers do not need to prepare their posters.

<p>Video recordings will be made of oral presentations; more details to be announced.
